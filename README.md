AI-Powered Fraud Detection in E-Commerce
This repository contains an advanced AI-based system designed to detect fraudulent activities in e-commerce transactions in real-time. Leveraging LSTM-based deep learning models, OpenVINO acceleration, and interactive visual dashboards, this solution ensures secure, fast, and intelligent fraud detection for online platforms.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
E-commerce platforms are constantly vulnerable to fraudulent transactions, ranging from stolen credit cards to automated abuse. This project aims to solve this challenge by using AI to recognize unusual behavior patterns in transactional data and take immediate action through a responsive dashboard. The system provides clear visual feedback, logs fraud attempts, and enhances transparency for human-readable fraud explanations.

OBJECTIVES:
- Build an efficient, real-time fraud detection pipeline.
- Use LSTM to detect temporal fraud patterns.
- Optimize models using OpenVINO for deployment on Intel hardware.
- Provide batch inference for large-scale fraud scanning.
- Enable interactive visual analytics via a Flask dashboard.
- Incorporate GenAI to explain flagged transactions in natural language.
